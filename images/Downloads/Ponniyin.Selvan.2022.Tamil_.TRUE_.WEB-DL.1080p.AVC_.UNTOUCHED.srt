1
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:01,040
"PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 1"

2
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,730
A thousand years ago

3
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,370
before the dawn of the golden era

4
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,750
a comet appeared in the Chola sky.

5
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,720
Emperor Sundara Chozhar
who ruled in Thanjavur

6
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,970
had two sons and a daughter.

7
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,370
His eldest son, the crown prince,
the brave warrior, Aditha Karikalan

8
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,530
defeated the Pandyas on
the Sevur battlefield,

9
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,640
beheading their King Veera Pandiyan.

10
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,440
To avenge their king’s death,

11
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,650
Pandyan assassins infiltrated
the Chola kingdom,

12
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,620
vowing to destroy the Chola dynasty.

13
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,740
The younger prince, Arunmozhi Varman

14
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
had arrived in Lanka with his
vast fleet to win that land.

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,880
Meanwhile, the tempestuous
Aditha Karikalan

16
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,180
was leading an army to the north
to conquer the Rashtrakutas.

17
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,980
While his father, the Emperor,
lay ailing in Thanjavur.

18
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,930
The Emperor and his two sons
were in mortal danger.

19
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,940
In the sky the comet was baying
for royal Chola blood…

20
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,100
Rashtrakuta Nadu

21
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,210
My prince.

22
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,910
My prince.

23
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,190
Fireballs!

24
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,520
The armoury is behind the east wall.
Destroy it!

25
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,480
Victory!

26
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,980
Victory!

27
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,830
Victory is ours!

28
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,530
Victory is ours!

29
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,200
Victory is ours!

30
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,310
Hail to Prince Aditha Karikalan!

31
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,100
Hail to Prince Aditha Karikalan!

32
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,530
Prince, the king of the Rashtrakutas,
King Khottiga lies at your feet.

33
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,780
Khottiga.

34
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,490
I welcome a glorious death.

35
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,160
Hail to…

36
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,990
Go!

37
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,690
I will not slay another unarmed foe.

38
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,280
-Go!
-Aditha, kill me!

39
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,950
Sparing my life is condemning me
to a life without dignity.

40
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,530
Give me a glorious death.
Slay me!

41
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,990
Aditha, you’re making a grave mistake.

42
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,410
A wounded elephant is a tiger’s
mortal enemy.

43
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,030
The crown prince awaits us.
Come, Semba. Let’s go.

44
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,580
Salutations to the Chola crown prince.

45
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,740
Vallavarayan, you have bathed!

46
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Nice clean clothes, flowers too.

47
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,490
Flowers of glory. At the tavern…

48
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,410
-Tavern?
-Not the tavern, the temple.

49
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,350
Is a winery nearby? Or a temple?

50
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,160
Give me your dagger.

51
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,790
Prince, will you dismiss me from
your army because I drank wine?

52
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,370
Your dagger, my friend.

53
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,370
I want you to go to Kadambur Fort.

54
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,120
My Prince, Parthibendran knows
the Chola kingdom well,

55
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,620
send him there. I'll stay here
with you.

56
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,990
On the next full moon,

57
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,580
an untoward event will take place
at the Fort.

58
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,410
Our spies have warned us.

59
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,710
Find out what they are plotting.
Will you go?

60
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,960
From there

61
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,540
journey on to Thanjavur
and inform the emperor.

62
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,650
My sister Kundavai is in
Pazhayarai Palace.

63
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,750
Tell her what you find out.

64
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:38,450
The Chola dam drapes
the sacred River Ponni

65
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,460
Crops blossom to the sound
of the flowing river

66
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,580
Stones sharpen to the sound
of the chisel

67
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,340
Bows stretch to the sound
of the enemy

68
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,960
All words flower to sing praise
of the Chola land

69
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,700
I must see the River Ponni

70
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,840
before the sun goes down

71
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,120
I must admire the lovely beauties

72
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,240
Silent as the breeze

73
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,280
Crossing barren lands

74
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,530
Crossing dusty lands

75
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,530
Crossing parched lands

76
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,910
Semba!

77
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,780
Semba!

78
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,660
Where were you? I was worried.

79
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,160
Beauty makes me lose
the track of Time

80
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,060
-O land, as I lie upon your chest
-Lush green fields

81
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,950
Desires stir in me

82
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,820
Will Time turn in my favour?

83
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,090
Will my legs never tire?

84
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,700
O Semba!

85
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,930
I hear you galloping ahead

86
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,610
This lady Ponni

87
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,240
Singing softly as she flows

88
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,490
Gallop away to the valiant Chola land

89
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,200
Jump with joy!

90
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,360
Swift like the flowing river

91
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,490
My friend, go!

92
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,570
Fulfil our dreams

93
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,860
I must see the River Ponni

94
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,090
before the sun goes down

95
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I must admire all the beauties

96
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,200
Silent as the breeze

97
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,860
O fair-skinned beauty

98
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,320
Dwell in my heart

99
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,610
O mischievous lady

100
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,320
Stay close to me

101
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,860
So much beauty to behold!

102
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,150
Ayya, who is that?

103
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,070
The most powerful Chola Chieftain,
Periya Pazhuvettarayar.

104
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,190
Asking such a foolish question
will get you thrashed.

105
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,190
Semba! Be quiet.

106
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,860
Fool! Your God has given you
clay for brains!

107
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,690
If my brains are clay, your whole
body is made of clay. Stolen clay.

108
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,270
Look at the sacred marks stacked like
50 clay pots on your brow.

109
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,020
Don’t speak of my sacred marks,
or I’ll pull your tongue out.

110
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,820
I have the power of six shastras in me.
I am Alwarkkadiyan Nambi.

111
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,480
Six shastras? I took your belly
for a mountain of appams.

112
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,730
Don’t you dare talk about my belly!
You charcoal pot!

113
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,110
You look like a clay owl!

114
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,630
All Gods are the same.

115
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
-Really? Are they all one?
-Yes!

116
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,480
Then the one God is Mahavishnu.

117
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,650
Shiva is greater.

118
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,820
Stop this quarrel!
Shiva and Vishnu are both Gods.

119
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,570
We are all gods. God is in you,
in me, in everything.

120
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,150
-So God is in this staff?
-Yes.

121
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,860
Watch as one God attacks another.

122
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,980
Ayyo, oh God!

123
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,770
Hey, tuft of hair. Big belly!

124
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,520
Then this sword is a more powerful god
than your staff.

125
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,690
Oh God!

126
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,100
He's killing me. I am Mahavishnu’s
fearless servant.

127
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,150
Fearless servant indeed!

128
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,270
Well, tell me now.
Who is the greater god?

129
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,020
Shiva? Or Vishnu?

130
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,150
When you’re sitting on me,
you’re the greatest of all.

131
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,220
Get up.

132
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,360
You seem strong and you look intelligent.

133
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,150
Let's settle this quarrel. Who is
the supreme God? Vishnu? Or Shiva?

134
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,750
I politely asked both Gods
the same question.

135
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,970
They said they were of the same height.

136
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,250
I even asked Brahma.

137
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,790
-You know what He said?
-What?

138
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,370
"Vishnu and Shiva are the same. Those
who do not believe it must eat mud."

139
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,830
I’ll thrash you.

140
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,710
Oh God!

141
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,110
Stop!

142
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,500
A brave warrior who carries
64 wounds from 24 battles.

143
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,990
The Protector of the Chola Dynasty!

144
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,880
The Treasurer! Here comes
Periya Pazhuvettarayar!

145
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,760
-He is Periya Pazhuvettarayar.
-I know.

146
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,930
Who is in the palanquin?

147
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,070
The Chieftain controls the Chola kingdom
and his young wife controls him.

148
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,360
Her name is Nandini.
She is his queen.

149
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,730
Ayyo! Who took my clothes!

150
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
-Who took them?
-Semba!

151
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,610
Semba. Stop!

152
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,850
-Thambi, can I ask you something?
-You’re greater than Vishnu.

153
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,940
-Go!
-It’s not about that.

154
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,570
Who are you? From where?
Where are you going?

155
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,480
Three questions. One reply.
Who are you to question me?

156
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,280
My name is Thirumalai.
Also known as Alwarkkadiyan.

157
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,690
My goal is to spread Vishnu’s glory.
I am a devoted Vaishnavite.

158
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,210
And my goal is to serve beautiful women.
I am a devotee of beauty.

159
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,590
So be it.

160
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,620
One more question. Are you going
to Kadambur Palace?

161
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,650
Kadambur Palace? Why would
I want to go there? Move aside.

162
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,640
A huge feast has been organised
at the palace today.

163
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,530
Periya Pazhuvettarayar is on his way.

164
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,530
There will be music, dance
and other festivities.

165
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,860
I’ve always wanted to see
Devaralan dance.

166
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,250
Semba, I'll sell you.

167
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,570
Take me there as your servant.
I will be most obedient.

168
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,070
Thambi, if you will not take me there,

169
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,950
-may I request something?
-What?

170
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,070
Will you give the lady in the palanquin
a message from me?

171
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,400
With a belly like yours, you plan
to romance a woman?

172
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,980
Semba, let’s go before we burst
his belly.

173
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,400
Wait! Take me with you.
Thambi! Brother!

174
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,190
Go! Make your way there!

175
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,190
You won’t get past the Fort gates.

176
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,870
Shame on you!

177
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,110
You disguise yourself as a holy man
and assault women?

178
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,900
-Sweet mother!
-Clear off! You with your tuft of hair.

179
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Kadambur

180
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,030
Stop! Stop!

181
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,380
He does not have an invitation.

182
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,710
What do you want? Your name?

183
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,170
Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan
from Vallam. Arayan is my title.

184
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,960
-He says he's Vallava…or something.
-Whoever he is,

185
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,210
we have orders to keep
the gates shut.

186
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,710
Your Prince Kandhamaran is my friend.
We fought against the Rashtrakutas.

187
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,210
200,000 soldiers fought
alongside the prince.

188
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,550
Thousands of donkeys too.

189
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,700
Is this one of those donkeys?

190
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,960
Let go of my horse. I’m going.

191
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,460
This donkey has quite a temper.

192
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,710
Let go!

193
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,420
Semba, charge!

194
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,670
Look!

195
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,090
Red, red, red, red!
Crimson red

196
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,460
Kandhamaran. Kandhamaran!

197
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,050
You invited me! Where are you?

198
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,670
Step back!

199
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,880
Red, red, red, red!
Crimson red

200
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,050
Kandhamaran! Where are you?

201
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,340
Kandhamaran!

202
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,210
Kandhamaran!

203
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,340
Vanthiyathevan, is that you?

204
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,510
Now it’s bound to rain in Kadambur.

205
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,050
-Welcome!
-At last!

206
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,430
Find the evil spirits!
Fell them with a sword

207
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,130
Was he the man making trouble?

208
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,030
All around us is war, war!

209
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,800
Blood is boiling

210
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,140
-Who is he?
-A dear friend.

211
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,300
Vanthiyathevan. A Vanar Clan prince.

212
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,170
The Vanar Clan? In whose army do you fight?

213
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,840
I fought alongside the crown prince
in the Rashtrakuta war.

214
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,840
But I am no longer in his army.
I am here.

215
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,400
They say you have sixty-four battle scars.

216
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,160
Don’t you believe it?
Want to count them?

217
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,010
We grew up on tales of your bravery.

218
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,960
You have a way with words.
Go, watch Devaralan dance.

219
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,150
O Red-hued Lord!

220
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,380
O Lord of the Spear

221
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,260
O Broad-shouldered warrior

222
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,590
O Protector of our clans

223
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,260
O Lord Muruga

224
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,000
The Lord who wields the Spear

225
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,710
O King of Kings with steadfast spear

226
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,340
Grace us with your auspicious words

227
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,210
Will the rains fall?

228
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,840
Will the kingdom prosper?

229
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,600
Will the glory of our ruler endure?

230
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,830
Will our people thrive?

231
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,630
The Goddess seeks the blood
of royal descent

232
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,260
Crimson red, crimson red.
Red blood pours

233
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,300
The Goddess seeks the blood
of royal descent

234
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,920
Crimson red. Red blood pours

235
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,420
Play the drum if you wish
to destroy your enemies

236
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,420
Spill the blood of a man
of royal descent

237
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,430
The Goddess demands a sacrifice.
Blood must be spilled

238
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,460
The Goddess demands the king’s crown

239
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,510
The Goddess demands a young head

240
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,500
The snake, the raven.
Omen of death

241
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,420
The Goddess demands a sacrifice

242
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,840
The Goddess demands the king’s crown

243
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,670
The Goddess demands a young head

244
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,340
The Goddess demands a sacrifice

245
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
A sacrifice!

246
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,150
How did Sundara Chozhar
become emperor?

247
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,040
Gandarathidar had the right to be
emperor twenty-four years ago.

248
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,880
But he died suddenly.

249
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,550
So his nephew Sundara Chozhar
ascended to the throne.

250
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,860
It was not his birthright. We made
Sundara Chozhar emperor.

251
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,420
-We placed the crown on his head.
-True.

252
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,270
Because Gandarathidar’s son
Madhurantakan was a child then,

253
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,770
so we left the Chola kingdom in
Sundara Chozhar’s care.

254
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,930
But when Madhurantakan came of age,
the throne was not given to him.

255
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,890
Instead, Sundara Chozhar

256
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,700
anointed his eldest son, Karikalan,
the crown prince.

257
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,930
The throne was Madhurantakan’s
birthright.

258
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,890
But it was denied to him.

259
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,930
Sundara Chozhar did not seek our advice.
Was anyone consulted?

260
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,600
Some were consulted.

261
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,390
He asked Sembiyan Maadevi
and Kundavai Devi for their advice.

262
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,640
No one consulted us Chola Chieftains.

263
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,970
Instead, he asked the women
in his palace.

264
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,270
-You find it amusing?
-Pardon me.

265
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,060
Something is concerning me,
and others share my concern.

266
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,720
What is it?

267
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,970
If he’s blamed for consulting women,
the same can be said of you.

268
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,350
We hear you consult your young
wife on many political matters.

269
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Vanangamudiyar! Mind your tongue!
Who are you accusing?

270
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,680
I do not accuse falsely, but when
we speak of political matters,

271
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,680
why must your queen be present?

272
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,930
Your question is fair. I am honour bound
to answer.

273
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,520
Can you wait till our deliberation
is over?

274
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,220
Pazhuvettarayar, so what do we decide?

275
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,310
Should Gandarathidar’s son, Madhurantakan,
be emperor?

276
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,850
Or the grandson of Gandarathidar’s
younger brother?

277
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,810
What does the Chola land dictate?

278
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,180
Gandarathidar is the elder
of the two brothers,

279
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,890
-so Madhurantakan must be emperor.
-Will Sundara Chozhar agree?

280
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,850
If we all agree, I shall convince him.

281
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,430
What about Madhurantakan? I hear
the throne does not interest him.

282
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,310
-He is a fervent Shiva devotee.
-You shall soon see.

283
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,760
Vanangamudiyar, let me now address
your accusation.

284
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,310
Prince, will you kindly step out?

285
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,430
Meet the Chieftains who wish
to make you emperor.

286
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,640
Prince Madhurantakan Devar!

287
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,020
Long live Prince Madhurantakan.

288
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,970
Long live the Shiva devotee!

289
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,350
Prince, was it you in the palanquin?

290
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,680
Is it the prince who graces
my humble abode?

291
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,850
Yes. I am Gandarathidar’s son.

292
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,600
I have a right to the Chola throne.

293
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,850
I seek your support in fulfilling
my destiny.

294
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,640
I value your support.

295
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,310
Hey, Vaishnavite!

296
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,310
-Alwarkkadiyan!
-Hurry! Row!

297
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,040
Let this rogue take the next boat.

298
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,520
Nambi, stop!

299
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,370
Hold the reins.

300
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,770
You there, big belly!

301
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,180
Thambi, mind your tongue!

302
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,470
But you responded when
I called you “big belly”.

303
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,930
Wait! I’m coming.

304
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,680
Start rowing!

305
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Where are you going?

306
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,560
I hear they’re serving milk Pongal
at the Srirangam temple. What’s it to you?

307
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,770
With your big belly, you could’ve
fallen, scaling those high walls,

308
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,850
-and cracked open like a clay pot.
-Me, scaling? What high walls?

309
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,180
Nambi, if you don’t want to land up
in the river, out with the truth.

310
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,600
You play the devotee with
your sacred markings...

311
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,810
-Are they the props of a good actor?
-Blasphemy!

312
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,270
I’m a devotee of the Azhwars.

313
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,060
Nambi, the Kaveri is full of crocodiles.

314
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,180
They love tamarind rice-eating Vaishnavas.
Shall I throw you in?

315
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,180
If you hurt me,
Mahavishnu will not spare you.

316
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,140
Crocodile, crocodile!

317
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,560
Why did you scale the Fort walls?

318
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,220
The Fort walls? Who? Me?

319
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,680
Really?

320
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,520
Wait. I'll tell you why.
I was looking for you.

321
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,270
For me?

322
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,890
Yes...yes.

323
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,890
They refused to let me in
and I cannot wield a sword.

324
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,930
I could’ve sung Azhwar songs. And if I had,
the guards would’ve kicked me.

325
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,180
What choice did I have? I had to scale
the walls to watch the dance.

326
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,020
-Did you see the dance?
-My arm!

327
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,850
I saw nothing. Only Devaralan’s bottom.

328
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,060
They were all bunched together
as though in a ritual.

329
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,850
They drew their swords and took…
What was really going on?

330
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,470
-So you saw nothing else?
-No. Did you see anything?

331
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,140
It looked like a prayer meeting.

332
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,180
How are you related to the palanquin lady?

333
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,880
Why send her a message?

334
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,600
Oh that? The palm leaf message.

335
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,430
The truth!

336
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,770
You’ll turn me into a fish if you keep
dunking me into the river.

337
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,350
In Pazhayarai, we lived next
to Ramanatha Battar’s house.

338
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,640
One day he found a baby
on his doorstep.

339
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,390
He called the child "Nandini".

340
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,680
She was like a sister to me.

341
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,560
I hoped Nandini would grow up
to become a devotee like Aandal.

342
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,430
But one day she left us and vanished.

343
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,060
Then we heard she had married
Pazhuvettarayar.

344
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,060
And I never saw her again.

345
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,030
That’s why I wanted to send her
a message.

346
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,060
What message?

347
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,520
"Lord Krishna is waiting for you."

348
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,720
Semba, there goes Madhurantakan!

349
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,930
Do you wish to see the prince?

350
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,930
Are you asking me why? So we can put
our strong limbs to use!

351
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,220
Move! My horse is blind.

352
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,310
Move aside! Move!

353
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,850
Prince, your men are manhandling
my horse.

354
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,600
Prince, save us!

355
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,180
You are…?

356
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,140
Speak up! Who are you?

357
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,140
Pardon me. Are you the Chieftain’s queen?

358
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,600
Tell me the truth.

359
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,890
Why did you barge into my palanquin?

360
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,520
Let go, brother.

361
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,600
Forgive me, Devi.

362
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,430
Alwarkkadiyan, who claims to be
your brother,

363
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,600
has sent you a message.

364
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,060
-Are you his servant?
-No, Devi.

365
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,270
I am Aditha Karikalan’s friend.
He asked me to go to Thanjavur.

366
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,270
Karikalan?

367
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,970
Yes. I fought alongside him in battle.

368
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,310
Very well.

369
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,270
Let’s not talk now. There are spies
amongst my palanquin bearers.

370
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,430
Come to my palace tomorrow.

371
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,640
Show them my Signet Ring.
They’ll let you in.

372
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,560
Thanjavur

373
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,560
Semba!

374
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,560
What a majestic Fort!
We'll build one just like it in Vallam.

375
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,560
-You dare mention Pazhuvettarayar!
-Are you a Pandyan spy?

376
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,310
- Who took my dhoti?
-Semba!

377
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,060
You fool! Not again!
Don’t show me your face. Go!

378
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,390
Don’t you dare follow me.

379
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,720
Does one get to heaven
even if the guards trample you?

380
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,180
No one can question the Velakara guards.

381
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Aren't they Sundara Chozhar’s
personal bodyguards?

382
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,060
They're Pazhuvettarayar’s
puppets now.

383
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,180
Last week a boy got into trouble
for saying that. He is dead now.

384
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,810
-Who are you?
-The temple flower-man. Sendhan Amudhan.

385
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,780
-Can you take me to the emperor?
-Close the Fort gates!

386
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,310
Serving you tamarind rice is easier.
Who are you? The Pandyan emperor?

387
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,810
-What is this scroll for?
-I write poems.

388
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,680
Have you any ink?

389
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,930
I want to rewrite Chola history. I must hurry
before the gates close.

390
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,430
-You can’t go inside.
-I bet on my horse Semba.

391
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,930
If I come back, I’ll reclaim Semba.
If I don’t, you keep him.

392
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,770
Using a wager so I’d look after your horse.
Cunning!

393
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,030
I live near Thallikulathar temple.
What's your name?

394
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,560
My Commander,

395
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,560
I am innocent.

396
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,020
-Your name?
-Kadhirvelan.

397
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,890
They thought I was taking
Pazhuvettarayar's name in vain.

398
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,520
But all I said was
“Please repair my cart.”

399
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,220
-Are you the Pandyan spy?
-No. You’re mistaken.

400
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,680
Commander!

401
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,550
He tried to enter by showing us
the Signet Ring.

402
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,450
Let go! Commander, I come from Kanchi.

403
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,460
The crown prince has sent
a message for the emperor.

404
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,910
This scroll is for the emperor.

405
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,290
The other is for Princess Kundavai.

406
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,370
There’s nothing of significance
in it. I’ll give it to the emperor.

407
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,000
No. I was asked to hand
it over in person.

408
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,460
Don’t you trust me? Or did the crown prince
insist you do it?

409
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,910
No, it was your brother, Periya Pazhuvettarayar,
who insisted I hand it over.

410
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,040
You met my brother? Where?

411
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,040
-At Kadambur Palace.
-Kadambur?

412
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,970
He gave me this Ring.

413
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,760
-Why didn’t you say so?
-No one let me speak.

414
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,430
Take him to the emperor.

415
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,550
Commander, the Ring...

416
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,750
Vanquisher of the Pandyas, Cheras and
Lanka, may the emperor live forever!

417
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Who are you?

418
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,410
Greetings, my Queen.
I am Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan.

419
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,160
Prince Aditha Karikalan’s friend.
He bid me come here.

420
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,080
Karikalan has built a golden palace
in Kanchi.

421
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,540
-He hopes you will visit it.
-Forgive me, Your Highness.

422
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,000
The scroll was written by me.
It was a pretext to meet you.

423
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,910
The crown prince sent me here.

424
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,870
-How do I know you are his messenger?
-I wondered about that too.

425
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,080
He said, "The emperor will recognise
my messenger.”

426
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,500
He asked me to go to Kadambur
and tell you what I heard there.

427
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,540
Kadambur?

428
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,410
Your Highness, the Chola Dynasty
is in great danger.

429
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,790
Those who swore to protect it,
now plot to destroy it.

430
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,910
-Who plots? What do you mean?
-My Queen.

431
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,080
The Chieftains met at Kadambur Palace
under Pazhuvettarayar's leadership

432
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,580
to plot against your kingdom.

433
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,250
The crown prince sent me to spy on them
and then come to inform you.

434
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,500
-Why didn’t you go back to Karikalan?
-He ordered me to come here.

435
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,710
He said I must warn you

436
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,410
and let Princess Kundavai know too.

437
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,810
Did you really fight alongside my son?

438
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,460
Yes, Your Highness.

439
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,560
In the Rashtrakuta war.
It was my good fortune.

440
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,330
Did you use this sword?

441
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,410
No, Your Highness. This sword
belongs to the crown prince.

442
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,910
When I was leaving, he exchanged
his sword for my dagger.

443
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,290
-This sword...
-...was forged in my armoury.

444
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,330
I gifted it to him.

445
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,200
He sent it with you so I would know
you are his friend.

446
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,250
Your Highness, come to Kanchi
with me. You are in grave...

447
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,960
I am in grave danger, Your Highness.

448
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,500
I seek your protection.

449
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,460
I am the sole survivor
of the great Vanar Clan.

450
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,120
If you return my kingdom to me,
I shall serve you till I die.

451
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,210
Forgive me, Your Highness. He was
allowed in by mistake.

452
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,230
Commander, he is Prince Aditha’s friend.
He bids me visit Kanchi.

453
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,790
The Commander has read
the message.

454
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,460
I will reply tomorrow.

455
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,070
He is our guest.

456
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,440
Commander, take good care of him.

457
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,910
I shall indeed!

458
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,580
Your Highness, I must return
the sword.

459
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,210
Thank you, my Queen.

460
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,050
Where is the guest palace?

461
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,140
-You’ll see it soon.
-It’s beautiful.

462
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,850
You’ll sleep soundly there. Your meals
will be served on time.

463
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,630
Let me have a look around.
I’ll be back soon.

464
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Who will face the Commander?
We’ll be dead if we let you go.

465
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,640
Follow me.

466
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,890
If this palace doesn’t please you,
there’s another underground.

467
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,550
Is that Velkarar’s army?

468
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,390
-Yes.
-Splendid procession!

469
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,330
Don't let him escape.

470
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,220
There he goes!

471
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,550
Forgive me, Devi.

472
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,220
-Can you take me to Pazhayarai?
-Thief! Thief!

473
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,130
Move!

474
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,760
Watch out!

475
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,180
Don’t be scared. I am a Prince!

476
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,800
-Mother, is that buttermilk?
-Yes, son.

477
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,350
Give me some.

478
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,800
Here.

479
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,450
To think I jumped over fort walls
for buttermilk!

480
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,680
How much?

481
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,640
It’s free.

482
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,630
Queen Sembiyan Maadevi’s gift
to the people.

483
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,720
Free? She is a most gracious Queen!

484
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,050
There’s the spy. Catch him!

485
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,350
Move!

486
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,470
-He is climbing up.
-Let's use the stairs.

487
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,050
This way!

488
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,640
He's running eastward.

489
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,350
Hey you! Catch him!

490
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,470
This is the crown Prince's sword.
I must return it.

491
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,220
Catch him.

492
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,850
He's trapped.

493
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,180
You have nine lives.

494
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,680
Oh God!

495
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,680
Climb!

496
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,930
Careful.

497
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,770
-What are you staring at?
-Is that really you?

498
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,470
Yes, it’s me. Who else could I be?
Careful, we may be seen.

499
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,180
Last time you had
a big moustache, right?

500
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Nice question.

501
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,550
I will be bald the next time.

502
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,800
Move aside!

503
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,470
-Come. Devi is waiting for you.
-As you wish.

504
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,540
My angels!

505
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,300
-You invited him?
-Hush!

506
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,240
Whose paradise is this?

507
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,680
Devi, the Sorcerer’s assistant is here.

508
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,350
You?

509
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,720
Indeed.

510
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,210
What sorcery allowed you inside
at this hour?

511
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,680
No sorcery. I climbed up
a rope ladder.

512
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,850
If you had showed them my Ring,
they would’ve let you in.

513
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,890
Why enter like a thief?

514
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,510
I was escaping the Commander's soldiers
and I saw the rope ladder.

515
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,140
You mean Chinna Pazhuvettarayar?

516
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,800
Does he not have absolute power here?
I showed him your Ring.

517
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,720
Don’t worry. I didn’t mention you.

518
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,010
I said Periya Pazhuvettarayar
gave it to me in Kadambur.

519
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,550
But he did not believe me.

520
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,600
-Where is the Ring?
-I have kept it safely.

521
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,050
I would not lose a Ring
given to me by you.

522
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,930
You said Karikalan sent a message.

523
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,260
No. It was Alwarkkadiyan. He said
he was like a brother to you.

524
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,260
-He sent the message.
-What message?

525
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,820
He said: "Lord Krishna is waiting
for you."

526
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,640
I can no longer become a devotee
like Aandal. That is a long-lost dream.

527
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,220
I do not agree.

528
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,510
Why not?

529
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,260
If Lord Krishna were to see you,

530
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,760
would He not abandon Bhama
and Rukmini?

531
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,400
He’d even drive away His 16,008 wives.

532
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,600
Men often praise me to my face.

533
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,140
If you turn your back to me,
I’d praise you even more.

534
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,220
Enough! You certainly know how
to charm.

535
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,140
-Now you're praising me.
-Then turn your back to me.

536
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,930
I never turn my back in war
or before a woman. I stand fearless.

537
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,720
You can praise me to my face.

538
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,100
You are indeed a true magician!

539
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,140
A brave warrior who carries
64 wounds from 24 battles.

540
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,220
The protector of the Chola dynasty.

541
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,140
The Treasurer! Periya Pazhuvettarayar
has arrived in Thanjavur.

542
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,050
Why do you look upset, brother?

543
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,470
Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan
came from Kanchi

544
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,100
with a message for the emperor.

545
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,970
How did he get inside?

546
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,930
He showed us the Signet Ring
that you gave him.

547
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,140
No! I did not give it to him.

548
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,760
So what was the message?

549
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,470
Only an invitation for the emperor
to visit Kanchi.

550
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,930
But I overheard the messenger warn him
of imminent danger.

551
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,470
Where is this messenger?

552
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,180
I intended to hold him prisoner,

553
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,800
but he escaped. We're looking
for him.

554
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,970
He cannot have gone far.

555
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,510
Why did I make you the Fort Commander?
Any fool can dupe you.

556
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,140
Shame on you!

557
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,220
Keep the door open.

558
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,390
The Pazhuvur lord is here.

559
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,760
-You did not tell me your name.
-It’s Vanthiyathevan.

560
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,010
-My title is Vallavarayan.
-And your kingdom?

561
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,300
The sky above, the earth below.

562
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,470
You can win your kingdom back.

563
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,550
It is not impossible.

564
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,720
Devi, I have no interest in ruling.

565
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,640
He had your Signet Ring.
That’s how he gained entry.

566
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,510
I gave it to no one.

567
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,890
How did he get it?
Who gave it to him?

568
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,390
-Who do you suspect?
-Your dear wife.

569
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,510
Mind your tongue or I’ll cut it off!

570
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,260
No!

571
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,550
-Get rid of her.
-Silence!

572
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,970
Do me a favour.

573
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,510
I give my life for beautiful women.
For you, I’d die many times over.

574
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,300
But now I must go to Pazhayarai.

575
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,800
I have a scroll for
the Chola Princess Kundavai.

576
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,550
What scroll?

577
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,550
I can help you escape from here.

578
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,140
On one condition.

579
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,550
The reply the Princess gives to this scroll

580
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,800
must be brought to me.
Will you do that?

581
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,600
Devi, it could be dangerous.

582
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,390
You will be rewarded.

583
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,350
And rewarded way beyond
your wildest dreams.

584
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,180
This secret passage will lead outside.

585
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,220
You’ll pass a treasure chamber.

586
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,850
Do not let the treasures there
tempt you.

587
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,260
I stand before a shining diamond.

588
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,710
Are you dazzled?

589
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,900
A little.

590
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,470
Who are you?

591
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,350
Glory to the Pazhuvur lord!

592
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,600
Where is my queen?

593
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,390
Where is Nandini?

594
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,970
Where is the Signet Ring?

595
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,010
-Have you lost it?
-Is that what brings you here?

596
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,890
Did you not come to see me?

597
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,510
-Who are you?
-The Sorcerer!

598
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,350
How do you know me?

599
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,200
You’re a Sorcerer and so am I.

600
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,790
See? I have the Signet Ring.

601
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,570
Let go! Someone’s coming.

602
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,620
Do you know the Ring's value?
Someone has stolen it.

603
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,370
He did not steal it.
I gave it to that soldier.

604
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,410
He is a spy, not a soldier.

605
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,410
I know. That’s why I gave it to him.

606
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,750
I met him near Thanjavur.

607
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,210
I realised he was a spy,
so I asked him to come here.

608
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,420
I wanted to know who he worked for

609
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,670
and why he came to the Fort.

610
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,960
He is Karikalan’s spy.

611
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,100
How did your brother find out?

612
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,740
Was it not my Ring that made him
suspicious?

613
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,550
But he still let him escape.

614
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,720
Did the Commander know
where the spy was going?

615
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,890
He was headed to see Kundavai
in Pazhayarai.

616
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:13,050
Once he meets her, he will bring
her reply to me.

617
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,220
Did I do wrong?

618
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,640
My eyes see only your beauty.

619
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,390
Your beauty veils your intelligence.
I am helpless.

620
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,550
Madhurantakan is on his way.

621
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,850
Salutations to the Pazhuvur lord
and Nandini Devi.

622
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,510
Welcome!

623
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,350
You no longer need to enter
through the secret passage.

624
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,010
You shall soon enter as emperor,
astride the royal elephant.

625
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,350
If Shiva wills it.

626
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,610
Ravidasan.

627
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,130
You’ve forgotten the promise you made
to King Veera Pandiyan,

628
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:18,150
and the oath we took
to avenge our king’s death.

629
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,050
I carry deep wounds.

630
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,600
I forget nothing.

631
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,730
Stop this play-acting! It is our
duty to destroy the Cholas.

632
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,010
Are you now enchanted by luxury
since becoming the Pazhuvur queen?

633
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,350
You are right.

634
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,100
I am enchanted.

635
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,800
Will you behead me for that?

636
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,800
Kani.

637
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,550
Here are the Lankan coins you asked for.

638
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,470
Go to Lanka and bring me
the young Prince’s head.

639
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,850
May Goddess Kottravai be aware of this

640
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,060
May Goddess Kottravai be aware
of the dead king's wrath

641
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:30,270
The brave Pandyas will wash
Your feet with Chola blood

642
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,800
The Pandyan kingdom is where
the Pandyan Emperor lives.

643
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,390
This forest is Madurai to us.

644
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,220
Behold Amarabujanga Pandiyan,
son of Veera Pandiyan.

645
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,930
He graces the Pandyan throne.

646
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,860
Beautiful dark-skinned Goddess Kali

647
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,100
Goddess of the waves, mountains,
the arts. Hail Kali!

648
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,390
Let us pledge our lives.

649
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,880
Glorious Kali. Grace us with victory,
Goddess Kottravai!

650
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,180
We pledge our lives to the Pandya flag!

651
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,470
We pledge our lives to the Pandya flag!

652
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,080
We pledge our lives to
the Pandyan emperor!

653
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,510
We pledge our lives to
the Pandya emperor!

654
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,600
For killing our beloved
King Veera Pandiyan,

655
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,390
we will sever the head of the
Chola Prince Aditha Karikalan.

656
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,100
-Our blood is boiling!
-Revenge!

657
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,760
Death to his brother Arunmozhi Varman!

658
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,640
Death to the Chola Emperor
Sundara Chozhar!

659
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,600
We’ll offer their blood to Kottravai.

660
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,510
We will! We will!

661
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,300
-Are you the spy?
-Hush!

662
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,540
I am the crown prince’s friend. That’s
why Pazhuvettarayar is after me.

663
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,390
I must go to Pazhayarai at once.
But I do not know the way.

664
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,220
-Come with me.
-Me?

665
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,800
-Who will conduct the temple prayers?
-Listen to me!

666
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,680
I must meet Princess Kundavai.

667
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,550
If you do not help me, I’ll be caught.

668
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,470
You’d be responsible for my death.

669
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,390
I will come back as a ghost
to haunt you and drink your blood.

670
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,180
Very well.

671
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:22,660
Pazhayarai

672
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,320
“Attention! A spy has escaped
from Thanjavur.

673
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,660
“If you see anyone acting suspiciously,

674
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,030
“alert the soldiers.

675
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,910
“The emperor’s command.”

676
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,450
I came to awaken your senses

677
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,320
I came to make you see sense

678
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,490
I came to awaken your senses

679
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,000
I came to make you see sense

680
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,200
O Demon uncle! O Sun of the night

681
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,370
Don’t turn red in anger

682
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,410
Your sixth sense has lost all sense

683
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,910
O Demon uncle! O Sun of the night

684
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,280
Don’t turn red in anger

685
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,820
Your sixth sense has lost all sense

686
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,620
Warrior, warrior, warrior!
O mighty warrior

687
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,490
His bravery is as deep
as a banyan tree roots

688
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,120
-Salutations to Kundavai Devi.
-Sendhan, what is it?

689
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,410
I heard the announcement.
Are they looking for you?

690
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,820
Princess, I’m a poor temple flower-man.
Who’d be looking for me?

691
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,030
-They’re looking for a spy.
-A spy?

692
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,910
I met a man in Thanjavur.
Maybe it was him.

693
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,030
He was cunning. He even managed
to meet the emperor.

694
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,280
Made to destroy.
Made from a legacy of might

695
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,540
Here comes the king
with the face of Kamsan

696
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,700
The son of power,
eternal friend of Truth

697
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Not unlike a pearl.
I am the unique and only son

698
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,070
O little boy!

699
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,620
I have won the universe

700
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,270
Conquered all kingdoms.
They are mine, O mighty emperor!

701
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,950
Is there anyone to equal me
in this universe?

702
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,070
O Wicked One. O Sorcerer!

703
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,320
Who is here?

704
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,910
I touch the oceans.
The mark on my brow is the sun

705
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,770
I parade around North Madurai

706
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,870
Can you not think?
Are you not strong?

707
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,320
I’m just a little child. Have you
no shame to shout and rule?

708
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,660
What did this spy look like?

709
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,870
Like a spy.

710
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,070
He claims to be the crown prince’s friend.

711
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:04,280
Sometimes he disguises himself
as the demon Kamsan.

712
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,370
Kamsan?

713
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,160
He insists that he must see you alone.

714
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,070
If you see the spy again…

715
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,030
Should I hand him in
and collect my reward?

716
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,410
No, bring him to me.
I have a task for him.

717
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,780
O Uncle!

718
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,780
O Uncle!

719
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,570
O Demon uncle

720
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,640
O Demon uncle

721
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,450
O Uncle!

722
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,240
Sister!

723
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,320
Boatman, careful.

724
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,320
A watery grave has been predicted for me.

725
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,620
King Kamsan, why did you want
to see me alone?

726
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,070
Sendhan Amudhan told me.

727
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,450
Kamsan will answer. But who you are?

728
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,240
Who did you want to meet
in Pazhayarai?

729
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,160
The Chola emperor’s daughter,
Karikalan’s younger sister.

730
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,070
Arunmozhi Varman’s older sister.

731
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,740
The illustrious Chola Princess
Kundavai Devi.

732
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,410
I bear all these titles with difficulty.

733
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,450
Demon Kamsan, why do you tremble?
Are you scared of water?

734
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,570
Kamsan? Scared?

735
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,280
Demons don’t swim in water.

736
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,320
We swim in a sea of flames.

737
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,120
I wasn’t trembling, I was dancing.

738
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,010
Princess!

739
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,160
What a transformation!
From demon to spy.

740
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:20,570
I had no choice.
Pazhuvettarayar is after my blood.

741
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:24,570
And that fake Vaishnavite Nambi
follows me everywhere.

742
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,620
Why were you looking for me?

743
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,240
Karikalan sent me to Kadambur, Devi.
A secret meeting has taken place there.

744
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:39,160
Prince Madhurantakan was taken there
in Nandini Devi’s palanquin.

745
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,780
I have only one question.

746
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,660
Did Madhurantakan agree
to the conspiracy?

747
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,370
He wished to be emperor.

748
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:03,700
The lust for power surpasses
the lust for beauty.

749
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:10,450
Very well. Where is my brother’s
message? Do you have it?

750
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,530
Yes, Devi. I wrote the message myself.
Coming empty-handed did not seem right.

751
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,540
Show it to me.

752
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,700
"This messenger is a great warrior..."

753
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,410
Such modesty!

754
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,700
Books say modesty must not
dwarf truth.

755
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:45,740
What book? The one you're writing?

756
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,740
Yes, Devi.

757
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,700
In the war against the Rashtrakutas,
did you not fight alongside my brother?

758
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,320
I was by his side. I killed over
a thousand soldiers.

759
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,450
All right. A hundred? Over fifty?

760
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,910
If I lower the number any further,
my bravery will be in doubt.

761
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:12,780
So shall I send you on a dangerous
mission, befitting a brave warrior?

762
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,570
Is that my reward?

763
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,200
After all, you are a brave warrior
and have slain over 50 soldiers.

764
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,660
That is true. I await your command.

765
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,030
I want you to go to Lanka.

766
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:31,240
Find my brother Arunmozhi and bring him
to me. Can you do that?

767
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:38,240
I will seek the Lord of Death,
if you command me.

768
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:40,490
Really?

769
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,740
I swear on you.

770
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:50,490
Very well. I command you
to jump into this river.

771
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,700
Not the river, Devi.

772
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:03,280
You’ll have the message for my brother
before you go.

773
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,780
But the crown prince is waiting
for me.

774
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,820
I shall let him know. He’ll wait for you.

775
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,570
And so will I.

776
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:20,240
There’s a reward of 1000 gold coins
on your head. Careful!

777
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,910
My life belongs to you, Devi.

778
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,740
I will stay alive to fulfil your mission.

779
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,320
King Kamsan!

780
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,490
Do me a favour.

781
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,870
When Lord Krishna Himself asks,
can Kamsan refuse?

782
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,030
Will you give Ponniyin Selvan
a message from me?

783
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:58,740
Certainly!

784
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,740
Go!

785
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,490
Salutations, Prince.

786
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,160
Salutations, mother.

787
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,780
Madhurantakan, is what I hear true?

788
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,490
What have you heard?

789
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:41,910
-That you wish to ascend to the throne.
-Mother, the throne belongs to me.

790
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,740
To you? Who told you that?

791
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,820
Your father gave it to Sundara Chozhar.

792
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,660
I want it back.

793
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,570
How can you take back what was given
by your father?

794
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,910
You raised me as a Shiva devotee
against my wishes.

795
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,280
I am not a Shiva devotee.
I am a king.

796
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,160
I am not a sheep for slaughtering.

797
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,660
The Chola throne belongs to me.

798
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,660
I am the elder.

799
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:22,280
My son, you do not know how to rule.

800
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:26,120
Karikalan and Arunmozhi
are great warriors,

801
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,490
while you can barely wield a sword.

802
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,160
Mother, I have the support
of many great Chieftains.

803
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,240
They have taken an oath to back
my claim.

804
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:41,070
I am your mother. You cannot have
the throne without my consent.

805
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:45,820
Your father commanded you
to live as a Shiva devotee.

806
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,410
You cannot stand against
Sundara Chozhar.

807
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,990
What kind of mother are you?

808
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,740
You stand by someone who has taken
my kingdom from me.

809
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,820
I will never let go of my right to the throne.

810
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:08,620
Even if my dead father were to
ask me, I would not heed him.

811
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,030
Here, have these prayer beads!

812
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,620
Break it down!

813
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,160
Break it down!

814
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,680
Nulambapadi

815
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,620
Charge!

816
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,990
Charge!

817
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:54,120
Victory! Victory!

818
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,160
Aditha, now that we have won,
let us return home.

819
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,030
No! We shall defeat the Kalingas next.

820
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,160
Your kingdom is in danger,
we must go home.

821
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:07,450
Karikalan, anything can happen
at any time.

822
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,780
Your father, your brother
and you are unsafe.

823
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,450
There is a plot afoot to seize your kingdom.

824
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,740
That's why I sent Vanthiyathevan
to Kundavai. She’ll take care of things.

825
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,950
Aditha, your sister is skilled in politics,

826
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,280
but she lacks experience.

827
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,950
Victory is ours!

828
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,820
Do not underestimate Pazhuvettaryar.

829
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,990
This Chieftain is like a fierce lion.

830
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:37,280
An old toothless and clawless lion.

831
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:42,450
Do not misjudge an old man
who marries a young woman.

832
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,780
Especially one who has poison
in her blood.

833
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,740
Karikalan, you are the Chola
crown prince.

834
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,910
You must protect Thanjavur.
You are duty-bound.

835
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,950
-The kingdom is your responsibility.
-Enough!

836
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,240
I will not set foot in Thanjavur.

837
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,780
You and your brother must
protect the emperor.

838
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,160
Stop!

839
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,700
Enough, Grandfather!

840
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,530
Why are you so angry?

841
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,870
Angry?

842
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,780
Who is angry?

843
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,280
Prince, I’ve noticed you get angry
whenever she is mentioned.

844
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,870
So you’ve noticed? So what!

845
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,740
Forget her. That's the best solution.

846
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,030
Forget?

847
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,870
To forget her, I must first cut
my heart out.

848
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,870
She was mine from childhood.

849
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:07,140
She is Pazhuvettarayar’s wife.
Desiring another man's wife is a sin.

850
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,990
Parthibendran.

851
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:18,780
She married that old man...
because of me.

852
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,280
Her folded hands

853
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:59,550
looked like lotus buds.

854
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,570
Delicate as a flower.

855
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,280
A pure white flower.

856
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,820
I was the crown prince.
She was

857
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:35,990
someone who sang
at the temple.

858
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:45,370
The entire royal Chola family
turned against us.

859
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:50,490
My father warned me. But I did not
heed him.

860
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,530
Then one day,

861
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,780
she disappeared.

862
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,820
Nandini!

863
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,070
A man dies several times
in a lifetime.

864
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,490
That was my first death.

865
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,990
I saw her again.

866
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,570
Many years had passed.

867
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,490
We were waging war against
the Pandyan emperor.

868
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,530
Veera Pandiyan had fled
the battlefield.

869
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,910
We hunted him in mountains and forests.

870
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,990
I found him inside a small hut.

871
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:14,820
That was the day

872
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,820
I died for the second time.

873
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
I became a walking corpse.

874
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:52,030
This wine, song, blood, war!

875
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,320
All this is to forget.

876
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,780
Forget her, forget myself.

877
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,320
Everything I do is a struggle to forget.

878
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,690
Tiger flag, war flag.
Our flag flies high.

879
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:10,350
The flag flies high

880
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,630
The horse is raring to go

881
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,660
The stony heart is stirred

882
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,030
See the sparks fly on the battlefield

883
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:19,740
Face the enemy with swords
and spears

884
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,990
Go forth and fight!

885
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,070
Let the Tiger Flag soar high
in the sky

886
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:27,530
May the Chola Kingdom
rule the world!

887
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,280
The striped tiger never fears nor rests.
Chola! Chola!

888
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,560
The fierce tiger does not know defeat,
O disciplined one!

889
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,950
My love for this land makes me
senseless

890
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,240
My love for this flag makes me
senseless

891
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,740
My love for this wine makes me
senseless

892
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,410
That woman made me senseless

893
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,660
My love for this land makes me
senseless

894
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:14,030
My love for this flag makes me
senseless

895
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:16,410
My love for this wine makes me
senseless

896
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,910
That woman made me senseless

897
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,070
O Demoness!

898
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:24,030
You are my breath, my wound

899
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:27,740
My body is covered with scars
from the battlefield

900
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,200
But the scar she inflicted
stops my heart

901
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,320
Worry not! Pass me the wine
so I may forget

902
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,790
This man’s journey will never stop

903
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:38,320
Carry that sword and march on

904
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,370
A vengeful tiger never stops

905
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:43,030
With a smile in your heart,
celebrate with a drink

906
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,570
Come, my friend

907
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:47,870
Is this pleasure everlasting?

908
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,700
Is it wrong to desire?

909
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,370
We dreamed of winning the world

910
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,870
We faced many battles

911
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,450
We ignored the Lord of Death,
slayed our enemies

912
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,910
We forgave foes who surrendered

913
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
Punished those who opposed us

914
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,120
We imprisoned those
who ignored our warnings

915
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:23,820
The Chola Dynasty is our life.
Taught it. Chanted it. This mantra

916
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,660
Touch the clouds, reach for the sky

917
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,660
Go, Tiger. Claim the Himalayas!

918
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,450
The flag flies high

919
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,740
The horse is raring to go

920
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,070
The stony heart is stirred

921
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:37,620
See the sparks fly on the battlefield

922
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,990
The flag flies high

923
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:42,530
The horse is raring to go

924
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,870
The stony heart is stirred

925
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,370
See the sparks fly on the battlefield

926
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,910
I beg you.

927
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:26,580
Spare his life.

928
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,030
Nandini.

929
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:35,540
No!

930
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:39,240
No!

931
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:29,000
Lanka

932
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,100
Soldiers, alert!

933
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,550
Charge!

934
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,370
Wait! Wait!

935
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,260
Charge!

936
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:01,010
Attack!

937
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,510
Make sure the prince is protected!

938
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,670
Victory is ours!

939
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,220
He has arrived.

940
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:47,530
The Vaithulya Bikshu Sangam
salutes the Chola Prince.

941
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,220
Master, you invited me, so here I am.

942
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,090
A comet has appeared in the sky.

943
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,800
We consulted ancient texts
to find out what it means.

944
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:19,720
A great king like Emperor Ashoka
shall rise among us.

945
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:24,420
You display all the signs of such a king.

946
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:31,300
The Maha Bodhi Sangam invites you
to be Lanka’s emperor.

947
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:36,760
This is the throne that once belonged
to Ashoka’s daughter.

948
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,920
All the kings of this island
are first anointed to this throne.

949
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,420
We give you

950
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:49,170
Throne, Sceptre and Crown.
Kindly accept.

951
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:53,760
Justice must prevail here. Lord Buddha’s
wisdom must rule.

952
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,470
This will all take place in your reign.
Accept the crown!

953
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:00,590
Accept the throne!

954
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,510
Accept the throne!

955
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,420
Master,

956
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,420
my father commanded me to bear
arms for the Chola kingdom.

957
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,760
As defender of the Chola kingdom
and servant of its people,

958
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,550
I cannot accept another crown.

959
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:30,760
I cannot defy my father’s orders.

960
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:35,880
So, I cannot accept God’s will,
or your request, Master.

961
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,410
I seek your blessings.

962
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,880
One who bows low is destined
to rise to the sky.

963
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,630
May you live forever.
May all your wishes come true!

964
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,090
Wait.

965
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,970
Let her come to us.

966
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:33,800
-Prime Minister.
-Princess.

967
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:37,010
Is all well? Has the emperor’s health
improved?

968
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:41,170
Chinese physicians are treating him.
He recovers well, my princess.

969
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,920
What concerns the people these days?

970
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,050
They ask why the emperor’s
daughter is still unmarried.

971
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,920
What did you say?

972
01:28:55,510 --> 01:29:00,340
A noble prince worthy of the princess
is yet to be born.

973
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,220
By the time he is born and of
marriageable age,

974
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,630
I shall be an old woman.

975
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:15,410
She is like dark lightning
gleaming like a silver fish

976
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,570
Clashing with the roar of thunder

977
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,190
Can lightning and thunder co-exist?

978
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:28,950
O eternity, can these two forces co-exist?

979
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,590
Welcome, Princess!

980
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:39,140
Your arrival has turned this Fort
into a place of beauty.

981
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,660
I hear this palace has all the world’s
beauty within its wall.

982
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:49,170
You’re right. Beauty is indeed captive here.

983
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,260
Captive?

984
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:59,240
Does the golden beauty not adorn
the throne?

985
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,720
Yes, but the gold has faded.

986
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,620
Faded gold is the most precious.

987
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:12,050
Gold shackles are still shackles.
Are they not?

988
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,440
But the key is in our hands.

989
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,550
One cannot outwit the princess.

990
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:25,000
Welcome.

991
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,710
Father, our enemies are amongst us.

992
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:40,830
They want another crown prince.
Not Aditha Karikalan or Arunmozhi.

993
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,400
Karikalan’s friend said the same thing.

994
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,110
Who is conspiring against us?

995
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,170
Who do they wish to crown?

996
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,880
Your cousin. Prince Madhurantakan.

997
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:04,170
This conspiracy was planned
by Pazhuvettarayar

998
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,520
and the other Chieftains
at Kadambur Palace.

999
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:11,200
I cannot believe it.

1000
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,500
Pazhuvettarayar raised me
with much affection.

1001
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,790
But he is not the same.

1002
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:24,640
Did you know the Chieftains
have come to Thanjavur in secret?

1003
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:31,390
They plan to meet at
Pazhuvettarayar’s palace.

1004
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,720
This passage is under
Periya Pazhuvettarayar's control.

1005
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,550
Where does it lead to?

1006
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:44,050
-Nandini Devi’s chambers.
-We must decide today.

1007
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,040
-Welcome!
-My respects to Pazhuvettarayar!

1008
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,290
Welcome!

1009
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,910
Meeting in secret like thieves
is not right.

1010
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:03,580
What if they find out?

1011
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,290
Chinna Pazhuvettarayar,

1012
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,290
do you not want Madhurantakan
to be the next emperor?

1013
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,330
Your presence makes it legitimate,
Commander.

1014
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,910
Princess Kundavai has asked Aditha
Karikalan to return to Thanjavur.

1015
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:20,120
-He may come with a large army.
-We must act before he arrives.

1016
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,830
Let us ask Sundara Chozhar

1017
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,350
to hand over the throne
to Madhurantakan at once.

1018
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:30,160
We’ll spread a rumour that the two Princes
march towards Thanjavur

1019
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,270
to challenge their own father.

1020
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:35,750
Sister, are we meeting Nandini Devi?

1021
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,870
No. We shall meet the conspiring
Chieftains.

1022
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,620
To imprison them?

1023
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,250
-No. To unsettle their plans.
-How?

1024
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,000
Through you!

1025
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:55,080
Prince Madhurantakan must be crowned
without delay.

1026
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:58,830
It must be done before
Aditha Karikalan arrives.

1027
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:03,700
-We’ll inform the emperor tomorrow.
-We Chieftains have decided.

1028
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,040
If the Princes join forces,

1029
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,200
our plans will be ruined.

1030
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,450
What is it?

1031
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:13,580
-Princess Kundavai Devi is on her way.
-She is here.

1032
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,290
The Princess is coming here?

1033
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,330
Remain seated.

1034
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,830
No need to worry.

1035
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:24,580
It is quite normal for the Chieftains
to meet me.

1036
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:35,900
She is like dark lightning
gleaming like a silver fish

1037
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,680
Clashing with the roar of thunder

1038
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:44,610
Can lightning and thunder co-exist?

1039
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:48,730
O eternity, can these two forces co-exist?

1040
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,910
May I come inside? Or do I offer
my respects from here?

1041
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,700
The Princess is here unannounced.

1042
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,370
There must be something important.

1043
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,000
Please come.

1044
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,870
Welcome, Devi.

1045
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,500
Welcome, Princess.

1046
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,700
My respects to you.

1047
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:24,460
It’s rare to see you two brothers
together.

1048
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,080
My respects to the Chieftains.

1049
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,870
I was passing by when I heard
you were all gathered here.

1050
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,620
So I thought I would stop by.

1051
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,370
We were planning to visit you, Princess.

1052
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:40,730
Before coming over,

1053
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,330
we wanted to discuss
tax matters with the Treasurer.

1054
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:48,750
That’s what brings me here, too.
We must lower certain taxes.

1055
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,370
Why?

1056
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,370
Princes Aditha Karikalan
and Arunmozhi

1057
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,620
are to marry soon.

1058
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,790
To marry?

1059
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,660
-They are of marriageable age.
-And their brides?

1060
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,290
We do not need to look very far.

1061
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:07,830
You all have daughters.

1062
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:11,410
There’s Manimegalai, your daughter.

1063
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:15,700
Siriya Velaar’s daughter, Vanathi,
is here with me.

1064
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,790
Vanangamudiyar, your daughter's name
is Madhavi, right?

1065
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:22,290
My granddaughter’s name is Thirumagal.

1066
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,540
My daughter is Thamarai.

1067
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,870
There is no lack of brave women
in our kingdom.

1068
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:31,590
If their horoscopes match those
of the princes, they’ll be chosen.

1069
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,360
Is that not the custom?

1070
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:44,200
Do not worry. Arunmozhi is yours.

1071
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:49,000
There must be a commotion inside
by now.

1072
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,370
“Commander, what is going on?

1073
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:58,450
“Your grand plans have been
thwarted by a young girl.”

1074
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:06,450
That wily Kundavai!
Must she always interfere?

1075
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:10,540
No one in the Chola kingdom
is more cunning than she.

1076
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,660
Get away!

1077
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,500
Aditha Karikalan may arrive
with his army at any moment.

1078
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:48,040
Kundavai has sent a spy to bring
Arunmozhi back.

1079
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,500
If the two brothers return

1080
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,750
together they shall seize
Thanjavur Fort together.

1081
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:58,910
They will kill the emperor and claim
that it was your doing.

1082
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,700
They will say you wished
to be the next emperor.

1083
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:06,700
Let them come.

1084
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:10,620
I can stand up to them. I have waged
countless wars.

1085
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:30,550
Conflict within the Chola kingdom
will do untold harm.

1086
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:36,580
A family conflict will give our enemies
the chance to enslave us.

1087
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,700
It will be the end of the kingdom.

1088
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:45,080
And the blame will fall on me.

1089
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,160
There is only one way to stop it.

1090
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:58,290
We must make sure Arunmozhi
and Karikalan do not unite forces.

1091
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,250
Arunmozhi alone should be brought
to Thanjavur.

1092
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,580
If the younger brother is inside the fort,
the elder brother will not attack.

1093
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:13,080
I have a suggestion.

1094
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:16,120
If you permit, may I share it?

1095
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:52,880
Hey, boat girl!

1096
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,590
Poonguzhali!

1097
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,800
Are you playing with me?

1098
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:03,550
I'll lose my temper.

1099
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,920
A watery grave was predicted
for me. Did you know that?

1100
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,740
Poonguzhali!

1101
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:58,130
Does the moon not know
the depth of the ocean?

1102
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:07,550
Will the eyes not reveal
the yearning of the heart?

1103
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:15,130
Has that wandering cloud
lost its way?

1104
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:16,790
Have you got spices and salt?

1105
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,220
There's salt in the sea.
Fetch it yourself.

1106
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:26,220
When will the horizon and the ocean
meet as one?

1107
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,930
The waves have no markers

1108
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,800
Hold this.

1109
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,650
The light of the stars guides us

1110
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,720
Poonguzhali.

1111
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,530
Is Sendhan Amudhan your lover?

1112
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,510
Did that silly flower-man say that?

1113
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,880
If he said that to my face,
I’d throw him into the sea.

1114
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,220
So, you’re not planning to marry him?

1115
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,660
Why?

1116
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:23,220
Sendhan Amudhan is my friend.
I cannot betray his trust, but…

1117
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:25,550
But?

1118
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:29,340
Do I stand a chance then?

1119
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,930
Don’t be hasty. Put that away!

1120
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,970
Do your work and I'll sleep.

1121
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:05,840
-Is this the Lankan shore?
-Yes.

1122
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,470
-What do you want?
-Will you do as I say?

1123
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:15,970
Certainly.

1124
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:22,340
I don’t believe promises men make.

1125
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,840
I swear on the sea,

1126
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,380
the sky, the earth and the eight
directions, I’ll keep my word.

1127
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:34,340
-Are you meeting Ponniyin Selvan?
-Yes.

1128
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:37,130
Ask him

1129
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,510
if he remembers Samudra Kumari.

1130
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,800
Is that your secret?

1131
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,820
Is that what your heart yearns for?

1132
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:00,630
Even if he does not ask about you,
I will remind him.

1133
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,840
Poonguzhali, I’ve looked everywhere
for you. Where were you?

1134
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:16,580
Is that Karuthiruman? What news?

1135
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,620
I’ve struck a good deal
for the boat fare.

1136
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,340
We need the money now.

1137
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,090
Why?

1138
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,150
-For the wedding.
-Whose wedding?

1139
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,960
Your daughter’s?
Why didn’t you tell me?

1140
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:36,090
Hey girl! You don’t realise my worth.

1141
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,590
I’m talking about our wedding.

1142
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:44,470
In your dreams! Why save money
for empty dreams?

1143
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,350
Why did you come all this way?

1144
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:18,530
To find medicinal herbs, tiger-claws
and elephant tail hairs for the emperor.

1145
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:25,630
We must gather all our rebels in Thamballai.

1146
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:30,720
Our mission is to kill Arunmozhi
as soon as we can.

1147
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:35,340
Aadhan Maran, Soman and I
will look for the prince.

1148
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,760
Varagunan, you look for
the Lankan King Mahindan.

1149
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:41,010
Let me find Arunmozhi.

1150
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:42,790
I will kill him.

1151
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:45,470
No! You will ruin our mission.

1152
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:48,010
What have you ever done?

1153
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:52,090
Ravidasan, no!

1154
01:44:56,510 --> 01:45:00,130
I’ve never hesitated in taking a life,
or giving mine.

1155
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,010
The time and the place must be right.

1156
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:21,970
I will wait here.

1157
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:26,550
I cannot enter without the
the emperor’s bidding.

1158
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:04,720
It’s difficult to meet
Pazhuvettarayar these days.

1159
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,300
Your Highness, I am your servant.

1160
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,680
Until you are well,

1161
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,970
your physicians have advised us not
to trouble you.

1162
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:19,010
What if I never recover?
Will I not see my friend again?

1163
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:22,550
Your Highness, we are here to obey
your command.

1164
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,970
Is it true what I hear?

1165
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:35,510
Madhurantakan wishes to sit on
the Chola throne? Is that right?

1166
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,190
I also hear the Chola Chieftains

1167
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:46,330
have chosen him as the next emperor.

1168
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:53,590
I do not care who plots against me,
but my word will remain law.

1169
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:57,470
Your Highness, I speak the truth.

1170
01:46:57,930 --> 01:47:01,680
Your sons compete with one another
for your crown.

1171
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:08,830
Arunmozhi covets my crown?
Who claims this?

1172
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,300
It may be a rumour.

1173
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:15,160
-People are talking...
-Did you pull out their tongues?

1174
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:21,340
You can stop these rumours.
Ask your sons to come here.

1175
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,630
Let Arunmozhi declare his brother
the next emperor.

1176
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:26,550
It’ll end all rumours.

1177
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:30,130
True.

1178
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:34,350
We have invited Karikalan to Thanjavur
many times, but he refuses to come.

1179
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:40,300
Our messages do not reach Arunmozhi.
Periya Velaar stops them.

1180
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:46,930
How do we make sure the princes
will come?

1181
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:53,760
We must invite Arunmozhi.

1182
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:57,510
Send him a message that
he must come,

1183
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:01,340
or else he shall be arrested
and imprisoned.

1184
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,590
-Imprisoned?
-It’s only an empty threat.

1185
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:08,050
Imprison him? On what grounds?

1186
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:12,380
The monks of Lanka offered
their crown to Arunmozhi.

1187
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,800
He refused it. He did not have
the right to do so.

1188
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:18,340
That crown belongs
to the Chola kingdom.

1189
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,720
He owes the emperor
an explanation.

1190
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:24,840
Explanation or imprisonment.
That is what we will tell him.

1191
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:29,050
No. Then he’ll be condemned
for defying his own father.

1192
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:32,200
He’s accused of that already,
my Queen.

1193
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:39,760
Very well.

1194
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:42,970
Issue my command.

1195
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:01,220
How can a father imprison
his own son?

1196
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,510
How is that possible?

1197
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:08,470
It is my body that is ailing,
not my mind.

1198
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,680
Then why?

1199
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,590
I want Pazhuvettarayar
to be responsible

1200
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:17,680
for bringing Arunmozhi here safely.

1201
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:21,710
They might think they have
won this time,

1202
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:25,920
but let my sons come. Then I’ll decide
what’s to be done.

1203
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,900
Go to the northern border
and bring Karikalan here.

1204
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,370
He has a reckless temperament.

1205
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,520
Only you can make him see sense.

1206
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,340
Why are you so downcast?

1207
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,930
You want Arunmozhi to come,
don't you?

1208
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,470
Yes.

1209
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:52,300
When I hear them talking, I sense
they have a hidden motive.

1210
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:57,430
Bring Karikalan to me. Go!

1211
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:16,800
Captain, once you reach Lanka,
find the prince.

1212
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:20,330
Give him the emperor’s orders
in person.

1213
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,180
Arunmozhi's Commander-in-Chief
Periya Velaar must know nothing.

1214
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:36,430
Captain, do you know what
the emperor's orders are?

1215
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:47,100
My lord,

1216
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:53,380
if my men know we go to imprison
the prince, they’ll revolt.

1217
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:56,530
They must not know.

1218
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:02,420
The emperor’s orders are only
for Ponniyin Selvan.

1219
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:07,470
My lord.

1220
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:13,360
Remember no harm should come
to the prince.

1221
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,690
Let us set sail!

1222
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,530
No!

1223
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,710
Thamballai

1224
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,280
That's too expensive.

1225
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:23,980
Thambi, your guru is calling you.

1226
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,030
Vanthiyathevan!

1227
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:35,110
It's me.

1228
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:38,280
So you’re my guru now?

1229
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,240
With my sacred markings,

1230
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:43,030
I can't say I’m your brother-in-law!
So, it’s guru.

1231
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,910
You don’t need to bow.
I know you respect me.

1232
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:48,530
Why are you here?

1233
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:52,200
Are you people trained
in curing body ache?

1234
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,410
Oh God. Let go!

1235
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:59,490
Goddess Kottravai has sent
two guides to help in our mission.

1236
01:52:59,910 --> 01:53:03,030
-What are you doing here?
-The same as you.

1237
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:05,320
I’m exploring this Buddhist town.

1238
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:09,030
Why are you following me?
Who sent you here?

1239
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,450
Vishnu came in a dream and said

1240
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:15,820
He was weary of being in Srirangam
so He has come to Thamballai.

1241
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,700
Lord Buddha is a form of our god.
But sadly,

1242
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,660
without mace, sword or discus.
Nor can He fight.

1243
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:24,360
-Are you saying Buddha is also Vishnu?
-Yes!

1244
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,240
What else did He say?

1245
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,450
Did He ask you to snore less?

1246
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:32,530
Vishnu said

1247
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:36,610
if I happen to meet a warrior
who talks too much,

1248
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:40,200
I must save him and keep him
out of trouble.

1249
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:43,860
Hey, Thambi! Did you see that?

1250
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:48,660
I see Buddhist monks and beautiful
women with flowers in their hair.

1251
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:52,820
Not them! I meant the mahout.

1252
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:56,110
Alwarkkadiyan, when beautiful women
are looking at me,

1253
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:59,490
why would I bother about
a mahout?

1254
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,450
How irresponsible you are!

1255
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:11,780
How did the Princess entrust you
with such a huge task?

1256
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:25,860
-Why did you ring the bell?
-Vaishnavite!

1257
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:31,200
-Can you come with me?
-This is what I was waiting for.

1258
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:32,240
Come.

1259
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,830
Nambi! Where are you going?
I’m coming too.

1260
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:37,780
Go away!

1261
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:43,030
-Is this a horse or a camel?
-Wait. I’m coming. Nambi!

1262
01:54:43,950 --> 01:54:45,360
Just wait.

1263
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:49,030
-And a horse for me?
-I was asked to bring him alone.

1264
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,780
We must follow them.

1265
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,780
Lord Narayana!

1266
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:55,760
Look after my bundle.

1267
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:20,180
Stop!

1268
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,080
-Give it back.
-Who is this scroll for?

1269
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:40,490
Who are you? Give it back.

1270
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,240
Or you'll answer my sword.

1271
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,000
Ayyo, here!

1272
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,780
Where's your sword now?

1273
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,770
If you are a true warrior, defeat me in
a sword fight, then take the scroll.

1274
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:01,990
Stop!

1275
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,120
Delighted to meet you, Prince.

1276
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,030
How did you know?

1277
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:25,580
The fact you asked how I knew,
that’s how.

1278
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,410
Long live Ponniyin Selvan!

1279
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:36,940
Long live Ponniyin Selvan!

1280
01:58:43,490 --> 01:58:46,330
Who are you? Why were you following
Alwarkkadiyan?

1281
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:49,160
Prince, I am Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan.

1282
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:53,330
I belong to the Vanar Clan. I am
Prince Aditha Karikalan’s messenger.

1283
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:57,080
Who owns this sword?

1284
01:58:57,410 --> 01:59:00,280
The Prince gave it to me and asked me
to see Princess Kundavai.

1285
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:04,780
My brother gave you this sword
and asked you to meet my sister?

1286
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:06,080
Yes.

1287
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:11,950
Brave warrior!
Welcome to beautiful Lanka.

1288
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:15,660
-Thank you.
-Did you enjoy my warrior’s welcome?

1289
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:19,120
If you wish, we can resume
our sword fight.

1290
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:23,370
I can’t fight you. I’m answerable to my sister.

1291
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:42,200
-The scroll is written in invisible ink.
-How do you know?

1292
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:44,680
What does it say?

1293
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,140
You must come to Pazhayarai
at once.

1294
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:50,520
Nambi, does nothing escape you?

1295
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:53,020
All God’s grace! I am a mere servant.

1296
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,430
Prince, I have another scroll for you.

1297
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:03,140
-Guess who sent this one.
-Did you write it?

1298
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:06,970
Prince, he’s a fake Vaishnavite.
It’s not God’s grace.

1299
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:10,310
This message is from Princess Vanathi.

1300
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,930
From the princess?

1301
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:15,460
-Another of your skills?
-Hush.

1302
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:21,180
She gave it to me without
Princess Kundavai knowing.

1303
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:26,850
She didn’t want any fake Vaishnavite present
when you read it.

1304
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:28,560
Nambi, let’s go.

1305
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,560
- Your bundle!
- Thank you.

1306
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:32,430
Shall we enjoy some fish?

1307
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:34,850
Ayyo! Blasphemy!
I am a devoted Vaishnavite.

1308
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:38,960
The One whose body is smeared
with holy ash.

1309
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:44,130
The thief who stole my heart.

1310
02:00:46,940 --> 02:00:50,530
The thief who stole my heart.

1311
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:53,520
Prince, it’s safer for you to stay here.

1312
02:00:53,810 --> 02:00:56,520
That was the Prime Minister’s message.

1313
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:58,470
Oh! So you’re the Prime Minister’s spy?

1314
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:01,560
Princess Kundavai told me
to take you to Pazhayarai.

1315
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,020
- Wait.
- You wait.

1316
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:04,720
I gave my word to the princess.

1317
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:09,310
The Pandyan rebels are everywhere.
You must be careful.

1318
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:13,720
Prince, ignore him. He gets scared
even if I utter the word "crocodile."

1319
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:15,720
-Say it then!
-Crocodile!

1320
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:21,600
You want me to stay here.

1321
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:24,770
And he wants to take me to Pazhayarai.

1322
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:26,930
What does the emperor want?

1323
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,850
Until he commands me,
I cannot leave Lanka.

1324
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:33,100
You do not know
what is happening there.

1325
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:36,560
The Chieftains and Pazhuvettarayar
are plotting against your father.

1326
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:39,720
Lord Narayana!

1327
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:44,600
My Prince!

1328
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:58,430
Hail to the Pandyas!

1329
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:03,890
For our king Veera Pandiyan

1330
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:40,670
Claim your dead, Goddess Kottravai

1331
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,250
Claim your dead, Goddess Kottravai

1332
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:28,850
Retreat! Retreat!

1333
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:51,490
Lord Narayana!

1334
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:55,640
Dear God!

1335
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:02,780
Prince.

1336
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:09,100
Stop screaming!
It’s only a tiny scratch.

1337
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:12,600
A tiny scratch? My sacred thread
has been cut into two.

1338
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:17,680
Nambi, who do you think attacked us?
They didn’t look like Lankan soldiers.

1339
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,390
No, Prince.

1340
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:22,810
It was the Pandyan rebels.
I warned you about them.

1341
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:27,150
Prince, who rescued us?

1342
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:30,160
Nambi, didn't she look familiar?

1343
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,010
You must have hit your head!

1344
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,270
He may be right.

1345
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:40,140
I think she looked familiar too.
I agree with him.

1346
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:43,170
I’ve seen that Oomai Rani before.

1347
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:48,570
Do you know why people call me
“Ponniyin Selvan”?

1348
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:49,880
Yes.

1349
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:53,530
When you were young, you fell
into the River Ponni by accident.

1350
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:57,200
Mother Ponni saved your life.
Thus… Ponniyin Selvan.

1351
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,740
It was not Mother Ponni who saved me.

1352
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:10,960
It was Oomai Rani.

1353
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:16,450
When she pulled me out of the water,
I saw her face.

1354
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,200
A face that is now etched in my mind.

1355
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,700
It was she who saved us yesterday.

1356
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:28,660
I realised she could not speak.
She was mute.

1357
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:34,030
Who is she?

1358
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:37,370
Why does she protect me?

1359
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:40,990
How am I connected to her?

1360
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:48,240
What do these cave drawings mean?

1361
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:51,660
What mystery do they conceal?

1362
02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:54,800
I could not find out.

1363
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,300
Mother, who are you?

1364
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:13,240
Hail to the beloved daughter of the Emperor
Sundara Chozhar. Conqueror of Madurai.

1365
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:17,740
Behold the Princess Kundavai.
She approaches!

1366
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:29,570
This old man is weary of seeing
bloodthirsty soldiers.

1367
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:34,620
To see my granddaughter is
as pleasing as sweet honey.

1368
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,370
I seek your blessings, Grandfather.

1369
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:40,070
Bless you.

1370
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:42,450
Go, your brother is waiting for you.

1371
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,370
Are you not Velaar’s daughter?

1372
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:49,320
You were born to marry Arunmozhi.

1373
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:53,870
The elders have fed this dream
into my heart for years.

1374
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:57,910
Tomorrow if the prince changes
his mind, you are all to blame.

1375
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:01,850
Until the day you marry Arunmozhi,

1376
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:04,130
this old man shall not die.

1377
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:06,570
Don’t make me wait too long.

1378
02:08:08,570 --> 02:08:09,950
You are the crown prince.

1379
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,870
You must come to Thanjavur
to protect your father.

1380
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,620
That is his wish.

1381
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,410
Is that why he sent you
all the way here?

1382
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:22,410
Everyone fears you, brother.

1383
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:25,950
That is why I was sent
to take you to Thanjavur.

1384
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:29,410
Until the Pazhuvettarayars reside there,
I will not come.

1385
02:08:29,870 --> 02:08:32,820
-Is it because of Nandini?
-No, because of you.

1386
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:36,200
The emperor did not drive her out
of the kingdom.

1387
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:37,370
You did.

1388
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:44,870
Yes, I told the queen about her.

1389
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:47,530
The Queen sent soldiers to throw her out.

1390
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:50,120
-My life was ruined.
-It was for your own good.

1391
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,780
You were jealous.

1392
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,410
Her beauty and intelligence
put yours to shame.

1393
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:55,990
She's an orphan.

1394
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,160
She did not even know her lineage.
She could not be a Chola queen.

1395
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:03,950
I am not just your sister but
also, a princess of the realm.

1396
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:07,710
What matters to me are the Chola people.

1397
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:10,660
None of us matter.

1398
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:21,910
You took her away from me.

1399
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,410
And turned me into a monster.

1400
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:32,450
I was indifferent to her tears.

1401
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,410
I turned her into a poisonous snake.

1402
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:42,870
Since then, day and night,

1403
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:46,160
she has continued to haunt me.

1404
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:50,950
Aditha,

1405
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:55,950
she is married. She is
Pazhuvettarayar’s wife.

1406
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,660
Don’t I know that?

1407
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:05,620
How could she forget me?

1408
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:11,120
She once said she loved me.

1409
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:14,910
Then she fell in love with Veera Pandiyan
and tried to save him.

1410
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,660
And then she married this old man.
How could she?

1411
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,250
I will not come to Thanjavur
while she is there.

1412
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,030
I cannot.

1413
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:09,490
Convince father and bring him to me.

1414
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:15,370
I have sent Parthibendran
to bring Arunmozhi here.

1415
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:18,030
He'll be here soon.

1416
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:21,910
I’ll take care of the rest.

1417
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:27,070
Arunmozhi will not come here.
He'll be brought to Thanjavur.

1418
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:31,370
Orders were given to imprison him.
Soldiers have set sail to Lanka.

1419
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:33,990
The emperor’s command.

1420
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:26,300
A Chola ship!

1421
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,420
A Chola ship!

1422
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:41,700
Wait! I’ll go and see.

1423
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:45,910
How many soldiers are there?

1424
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:48,740
About thirty.

1425
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,950
Are you from the Chola kingdom?

1426
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,370
That ship doesn’t look like
a merchant ship.

1427
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:13,880
Where can I find Prince Ponniyin Selvan
in Lanka?

1428
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:19,820
Why do you want to know?

1429
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:22,910
Do you mean you won’t tell me?

1430
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:25,370
Who are we here to imprison?

1431
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:29,490
Is your ship a prison ship?

1432
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:31,490
Are we here to arrest Ponniyin Selvan?

1433
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:38,240
They are Pazhuvettarayar's orders.

1434
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:43,160
Lanka is under Periya Velaar’s command.
Pazhuvettarayar has no influence here.

1435
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:46,370
Are we here to take Ponniyin Selvan
prisoner?

1436
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:49,620
Why was this hidden from us?

1437
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:52,450
The Chola people will not forgive us.

1438
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:55,030
He is their treasure.

1439
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:57,280
Turn the boats around!

1440
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:01,700
Do you think I am here by choice?
It is the emperor’s orders.

1441
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,570
We cannot disobey his command.

1442
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:19,450
Where is King Mahindan of Lanka?

1443
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,320
“Inside my turban.

1444
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,240
“Why don’t you take a look?”

1445
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:31,870
Rascal! You said you came to gather
medicinal herbs and I believed you.

1446
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:34,780
Your greed brought us here.

1447
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:41,990
Take me to King Mahindan.

1448
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:45,120
“Over my dead body.”

1449
02:14:45,530 --> 02:14:46,370
Stop!

1450
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:54,280
You will be richly rewarded.

1451
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:58,490
King Mahindan will be rewarded too.

1452
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:01,240
He cannot understand what
you’re saying.

1453
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:06,280
“They’ll kill you before you
get near him.”

1454
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:10,370
Do you want to see me die?
Or will you be the one who will die?

1455
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:11,700
No, no.

1456
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:15,280
I will take you to the Lankan king.

1457
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:18,650
I need more coins for my trouble.

1458
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:23,990
You must listen to me if you
want to meet the king.

1459
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:31,870
Come.

1460
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:35,570
Come.

1461
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:01,620
Your Majesty, he attacked your camp.

1462
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:05,870
He threatened to kill all your soldiers
unless they told him where you were.

1463
02:16:06,370 --> 02:16:08,120
I befriended him...

1464
02:16:10,490 --> 02:16:11,860
Tell him what you want.

1465
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:17,740
I had to use these methods
to see the great Lankan king.

1466
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:24,870
"You came seeking me.
Now die in my presence."

1467
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:31,990
I have an important message.

1468
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:40,620
A Chola ship arrived yesterday to take
Arunmozhi prisoner.

1469
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:43,820
Sundara Chozhar ordered his men
to come here, my lord.

1470
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,950
I saw them with my own eyes.

1471
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:51,740
Arunmozhi Varman will be without
bodyguards and alone on that ship.

1472
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:53,820
He’ll be defenceless at sea.

1473
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:57,760
If you wish to win the war, you will
not get another chance like this.

1474
02:17:08,450 --> 02:17:13,380
I am a Pandyan rebel. I want
Arunmozhi Varman’s head.

1475
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,070
Why didn’t you say that?

1476
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:23,240
My lord, give me twenty boats
and fifty soldiers.

1477
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:26,660
I’ll bring you Arunmozhi Varman’s
head and throw it at your feet.

1478
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:42,400
I can see Pallava’s flag.

1479
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:45,190
Periya Velaar’s men are approaching.

1480
02:17:46,360 --> 02:17:47,820
It's Parthibendran!

1481
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:56,240
Salutations to Periya Velaar!

1482
02:17:56,610 --> 02:17:58,280
Vanthiyathevan!

1483
02:17:58,940 --> 02:17:59,940
It's me.

1484
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:03,030
-You? Here?
-I am everywhere.

1485
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:05,690
I heard you died at
Pazhuvettarayar’s hands.

1486
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:08,530
I don’t believe I'm dead.

1487
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:11,400
Your tongue is sharper than your sword.

1488
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:13,860
Why not test my sword someday?

1489
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,780
You haven’t changed.

1490
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:20,190
I have come with orders from Karikalan.

1491
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,070
What orders, Parthibendran?

1492
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:25,900
You must come with me at once.

1493
02:18:26,570 --> 02:18:30,610
The Chieftains in Thanjavur
have turned traitors.

1494
02:18:31,190 --> 02:18:33,780
They are conspiring against
the crown prince.

1495
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:37,110
No one can hope to win
against my brother.

1496
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:43,190
I heard Aditha Karikalan say: “Only my brother
can defeat me.

1497
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,940
“So he must stand with me.”

1498
02:18:46,350 --> 02:18:48,640
That’s why he sent me here.

1499
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:52,860
Commander, what do you think?

1500
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:58,400
Prince, a boat girl came with news
this morning.

1501
02:18:59,150 --> 02:19:01,900
A Chola ship has moored at
the River Thondaimaan.

1502
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:03,990
It is here to take you prisoner.

1503
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:07,690
-Where is this boat girl?
-Here.

1504
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:20,280
Samudra Kumari, do you remember me?

1505
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:24,400
How could I ever forget?

1506
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:30,650
You once sailed in this humble girl’s boat.

1507
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:33,990
I’ll never forget that day as long as I live.

1508
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:36,550
Did you really see those
Chola ships?

1509
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:39,530
-I overheard the soldiers too.
-What did they say?

1510
02:19:39,870 --> 02:19:41,740
They are Pazhuvettarayar’s men.

1511
02:19:42,570 --> 02:19:45,990
They have come with the emperor’s orders
to imprison you.

1512
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:48,110
This is a conspiracy!

1513
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,150
Maybe.

1514
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:54,940
But if these orders carry the Chola
royal seal, I'm duty bound to obey.

1515
02:19:56,190 --> 02:19:57,150
This is folly.

1516
02:19:59,790 --> 02:20:02,950
There are only two occasions when
I must concede without question.

1517
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:05,650
When father and ruler command.

1518
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:08,860
And he is both my father and ruler.

1519
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:11,350
Poonguzhali.

1520
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:15,030
-I need your help again.
-Say no!

1521
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,500
Command me.

1522
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:21,530
I must go to the River Thondaimaan.

1523
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:23,040
No, Arunmozhi.

1524
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:26,280
-I can take you there.
-Hey, girl…

1525
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:29,610
Prince, I implore you. Listen to us.

1526
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:33,410
Prince, if you ignore us
and insist on going

1527
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:36,010
then our army and I shall accompany you.

1528
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:38,480
You must not stop us.

1529
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:47,100
Vanthiyathevan, put on this turban.

1530
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:53,440
Goodness! How can I?
It’s a Prince's turban.

1531
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:56,560
Prince, ask anything else of me.

1532
02:20:57,990 --> 02:20:59,240
It's not a request.

1533
02:21:00,110 --> 02:21:01,070
It is an order.

1534
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:05,070
It’s as though you had poured
molten iron on my head.

1535
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:09,220
One day you’ll wear a crown.

1536
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:13,260
A Chola princess will be sitting next to you.
I’ll be there too.

1537
02:21:14,470 --> 02:21:16,760
Consider this a rehearsal.

1538
02:21:29,390 --> 02:21:32,050
See that, devoted Vaishnavite?

1539
02:21:32,850 --> 02:21:34,260
Watch out!

1540
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:37,510
The Chola crown has landed
on your head.

1541
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:40,220
Keep your head safe.

1542
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:49,970
-Poonguzhali.
-Yes, my lord.

1543
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:52,100
Will you ride the elephant with me?

1544
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:53,760
I am blessed, my Prince!

1545
02:21:55,650 --> 02:21:57,840
We are surrounded by
Periya Velaar's army.

1546
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:12,390
Prince!

1547
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:15,890
A prison ship is here. We must meet it
with full force.

1548
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:23,560
The elephant has run amok.

1549
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:35,600
Save the prince! Go!

1550
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,510
Prince! Prince!

1551
02:22:46,970 --> 02:22:48,180
-Stop!
-Don't go alone.

1552
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:49,470
Soldiers!

1553
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:53,760
I am not the prince. Ponniyin Selvan
is riding the mad elephant.

1554
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:56,070
It ran into the woods.

1555
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:58,690
Find it. Go!

1556
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:26,880
What a grand ship! So many soldiers.

1557
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:29,050
Hey! Who are you?

1558
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:32,340
I know many secrets.

1559
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:36,330
I know why you are here.
I know what will happen.

1560
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:41,150
Prince! Prince!

1561
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:46,940
So why are we here?

1562
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:49,210
To imprison the prince.

1563
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:36,510
The young tiger is the first sacrifice.

1564
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:26,080
Glorious Kali. Grace us with victory,
Goddess Kottravai!

1565
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:43,940
The Goddess demands a sacrifice.
Blood must be spilled

1566
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:47,160
Offer his blood to Kottravai.

1567
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:50,580
Offer his blood to Kottravai.
Blood must be spilled

1568
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:51,570
Stop!

1569
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,290
Who are you?

1570
02:25:58,910 --> 02:26:00,450
You imposter!

1571
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:06,660
Instead of capturing the tiger's head,
we've captured its tail.

1572
02:26:07,570 --> 02:26:09,910
Instead of capturing the tiger's head,
we've captured its tail.

1573
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:52,370
Brother…

1574
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:00,540
Captain!

1575
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:04,620
Prince, they’ve paid with their lives
for trying to imprison you.

1576
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:07,990
Karuthiruman! What has happened?

1577
02:27:08,370 --> 02:27:11,490
They tricked me and fled
without giving me my gold.

1578
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,700
-Who?
-The Pandyan rebels.

1579
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:20,650
Captain!

1580
02:27:47,230 --> 02:27:48,690
He is not Arunmozhi.

1581
02:27:49,230 --> 02:27:51,230
Sorcerer, look carefully.

1582
02:27:52,770 --> 02:27:55,810
I am Arunmozhi.
You can see my crown.

1583
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:05,980
Punish me. I have failed.

1584
02:28:06,730 --> 02:28:07,600
Punish me.

1585
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:09,940
Punish me.

1586
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:12,690
The turban fooled me.

1587
02:28:13,230 --> 02:28:16,400
Devaralan has failed. I have failed.

1588
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:30,690
Stop!

1589
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:47,770
To the shore!

1590
02:28:52,170 --> 02:28:53,720
Ply the oars!

1591
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:12,520
My lord.

1592
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:44,980
Poonguzhali,

1593
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:47,230
the wind has stopped.

1594
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:28,400
The prince!

1595
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,150
Kottravai! Two heads for you today!

1596
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:52,700
-Hail to the Pandyas!
-Hail to the Pandyan Emperor!

1597
02:31:25,810 --> 02:31:26,900
Prince, to the right.

1598
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,960
Sail towards the ship!
Hail to the Pandyas!

1599
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:34,520
My lord.

1600
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:16,700
O Mother Ocean!

1601
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:20,760
Prince!

1602
02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:12,060
O brightest Sun,
where have you disappeared?

1603
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:19,550
I look all around the world for you

1604
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:28,600
The River Ponni is waiting.
The Chola land is waiting

1605
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:36,000
The River Ponni is waiting.
The Chola land is waiting

1606
02:37:38,230 --> 02:37:39,520
What is it, Vanathi?

1607
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:42,230
What's wrong?

1608
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:46,600
The moon is waiting.
But the Sun is nowhere to be seen

1609
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:51,370
But the Sun is nowhere
to be seen

1610
02:37:52,260 --> 02:37:54,680
Where is my beloved?

1611
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,850
Look at me. Speak!

1612
02:37:59,730 --> 02:38:02,440
-Is it Arunmozhi?
-Ponniyin Selvan...

1613
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:04,600
What has happened to him?

1614
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,650
The River Ponni has been orphaned,
Your Highness.

1615
02:38:10,540 --> 02:38:15,790
Where is my precious son?

1616
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:23,190
Where is my precious son?

1617
02:38:24,150 --> 02:38:27,730
Composure in trying times is
what makes a king a true king.

1618
02:38:28,310 --> 02:38:30,850
-Control your anger.
-This is not anger. It is bloodlust!

1619
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:34,810
-To war!
-Think before you act.

1620
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:39,650
This is Nandini's ploy. When I see her,
I shall behead her.

1621
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:41,100
Aditha!

1622
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:46,140
She is destined to die at my hands.
Or I’m destined to die at hers.

1623
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:22,130
"PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 1"

1624
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,290
"PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 2"

1625
02:39:53,220 --> 02:39:57,350
"PART 2"
